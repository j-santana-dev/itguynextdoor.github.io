## Introduction
In this post we are going to use PyTorch to build a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that can convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit. Of course, in a real-world scenario, we would use a formula to perform this simple conversion. However, since the goal of this post is to learn how to build a simple ANN using PyTorch, we will use it to perform the conversion instead. Why? Because it's fun! :smiley:

Of course, if this is your first time in my blog, you might read my previous posts to get some context:

* [Introduction to Deep Learning and Artificial Neural Networks]({{< ref "/blog/intro-to-deep-learning" >}})

## What is PyTorch?
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Meta. It is based on the Torch library and it is widely used in the field of deep learning by many important companies such as: Meta, Amazon, Salesforce, Tesla, and many more. PyTorch is written in Python (have I mentioned that I love Python? :heart_eyes:) and it is available under the BSD license.
