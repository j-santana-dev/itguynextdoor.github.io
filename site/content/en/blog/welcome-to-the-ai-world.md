## Introduction
In recent times, there has been a lot of talk about Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the media, on social media platforms, and on YouTube. People are even curious about using AI for practical things like... planning their vacations :smiley:.

It seems like everyone is really interested in AI at the moment.

However, along with all the excitement, there are also concerns and fears about AI. Some people think of it as a mysterious force that will take over the world, a scary thing that will take away jobs and make humans unnecessary. There are even those who worry that AI could cause the collapse of society as we know it :scream:.

But don't worry! Take a moment to relax, breathe deeply, and join me on this post to learn more about AI. We will explore briefly its origins, types, and applications. I hope that by the end of this post, you will have a better understanding of AI and you will be able to make your own conclusions about it.

## The 1 million dollar question: "What is Artificial Intelligence?"
Artificial intelligence is a field in computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

This is a good way to understand it, but personally, I prefer to use the term "**trained**" instead of "intelligent". Why? Because AI doesn't have real intelligence at the moment; it is simply trained to perform tasks exceptionally well.

AI is a vast field and it's not a new one (it has been around since the 1950s :open_mouth:). AI is composed of several subfields such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (we'll talk about some of these subfields in the future) and it uses algorithms and mathematical models to "learn" and make predictions based on data.

Now, have you ever wondered what AI looks like actually? Well, I have some sad news for you. AI is not like what you see in movies with spectacular visual effects. In reality, AI is more about mathematics. Yes, under the surface, AI heavily relies on mathematics. Here are some key mathematical disciplines that play a significant role in AI:

* Linear algebra: Did you know that the fundamental building block of AI is a matrix? Yes, it is! To be more precise, it's called a tensor.
* Calculus: This includes both differential and integral calculus. AI uses calculus to optimize the parameters of the models.
* Probability and statistics: AI uses probability and statistics to make predictions and to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions.
* Graph theory: AI uses graph theory to represent complex relationships between the data.
* And much more...

Okay, to be sure that we are on the same page, let's summarize what we have learned so far:
* AI is a field of computer science that focuses on training machines to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.
* AI is not a new field. It has been in development since the 1950s.
* AI heavily relies on several mathematical disciplines.

## An old known friend... but now with steroids!
You might be wondering, "Why is there so much talk about AI nowadays if it's not something new?"

Well, the answer is quite simple: it's because we now have the computing power to make it work :smiley:. Thanks to Moore's Law, the capacity of computers has been growing exponentially over the years. This means that we can process huge amounts of data and perform lots of calculations in significantly less time. It's a huge advancement for AI.

But is not only about the computing power. The availability of data has also expanded exponentially. We are now able to collect data from almost everywhere. This, too, is a game-changer for AI. The more data we have, the better AI can perform.

## Types of AI
Now is the moment to talk about the different types of AI. Basically, there are three types of AI:

- **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**: this is the most common type of AI today. It's focused on performing a single task really well. For example, a chess AI that can beat the best chess player in the world, but it can't do anything else. Here we can find all the AI that we use in our daily lives, like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, etc.
- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: This is between ANI and ASI. For example, here is where we find ChatGPT and other similar models. They are focused on performing a variety of tasks really well. They are not as good as humans in all tasks, but they are better than humans in some of them. At this moment, we are still developing this type of AI.
- **Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)**: this is the type of AI we see in sci-fi movies (for example, you can think of Ultron from Avengers). It's focused on performing all tasks better than humans. However, it is important to note that we are still far away from achieving this level of AI.

## Types of learning
We have already discussed the different types of AI, but now let's explore how they actually learn.

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: is a subset of AI and it gives to computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It's focused on learning from *structured data*. Things like *Supervised Learning*, *Unsupervised Learning* or *Reinforcement Learning* are types of ML.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: is a subset of ML and it's focused on learning from *unstructured data*. Here is where the famous *Artificial Neural Networks* live. As examples of DL, we can mention speech and image recognition.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: it can be defined as the ability of machines to learn, understand or translate human languages. It's a subset of DL. As examples of NLP, we can mention chatbots and sentiment analysis.

## AI in different fields
Today, AI plays a significant role in many aspects of our daily lives. It is present in several fields, and new tools are constantly being developed. Let's explore some examples:

* **Healthcare**: AI is being used to improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis. For example, we can use AI to detect cancer in medical images with a higher accuracy than human doctors.
* **Finance**: AI is used to identify fraudulent activities and make predictions regarding the stock market.
* **Marketing**: AI is employed to predict customer behavior and offer personalized recommendations.
* **Programming**: AI is being used to automate the process of writing code. For example, we can use AI to generate code from a description of the desired functionality.
* **Industry**: AI is being used to automate the process of quality control. For example, we can use AI to detect defects in products.
* And much more...

These are just a few examples of the applications of AI in today's world. The influence of AI continues to expand across many domains ...and it's not going to stop.

## AI is not perfect
Unfortunately, despite all the advantages of AI, it's not perfect. AI has several limitations. Here are some of them:

* If we don't have enough data, AI doesn't perform well. We need a lot of data to train AI models effectively.
* AI doesn't have creativity or consciousness. AI can't create new things. It can only make predictions based on the data it has been trained with.
* AI is biased and it can amplify human biases. This is specially true for deep learning models, for example.
* AI models are often considered "black boxes". We can't explain why an AI model makes a certain prediction. This is specially true for deep learning models, for example.
* AI makes mistakes. Since AI use stochastic methods and processes, it's not 100% accurate. In general, we will have to deal with a certain level of uncertainty.

## How about the future?
AI is growning exponentially, and it's not going to stop.  In the coming years, we can expect to see more and more AI tools in our daily lives. This will be challenging for humanity. We will have to deal with a lot of changes and ethical issues. For example,  what will happen to jobs that are replaced by AI? Will we be able to adapt to this new reality? Without a doubt, the future is going to be intriguing.

To conclude this post, I would like to share with you a youtube video that made me reflect a lot about this topic and how it could affect our future. The video is a TED talk with extracts from an interview with Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and co-author of the book *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*. I hope you find it as engaging as I did.

## What's next?
I hope you found this post interesting :smiley:. In the near future, I will be writing more posts about AI and sharing practical examples of its implementation using Python (I'm a big fan of Python :heart:). So, stay tuned!
