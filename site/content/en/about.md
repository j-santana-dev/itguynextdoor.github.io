DevOps engineer, language learner, voracious reader, programmer and a big fan of technology.

I broke my first computer when I was 15. Since then, I've achieved a Bachelor's degree in Engineering, made some good friends, worked for a few companies (from startups to big corporations) and learned a lot about software development and DevOps culture.

This is my personal blog, where I share my thoughts about technology, books, programming, DevOps, and other things that I find interesting.
